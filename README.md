# Bank-Loan-Data-Analysis
Comprehensive analysis of a year’s lending data at a Bank

## **Purpose**

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the bank’s loan portfolio over the past year. The findings highlight application volumes, portfolio growth, repayment performance, borrower demographics, geographic trends, and key risk indicators, supporting strategic oversight and decision-making for sustained business health and risk management.

**Portfolio Volume and Growth**

- The bank originated 38,576 loans during the year, funding $435.8 million and collecting $473.1 million in total repayments.
- Monthly trends show consistent growth, peaking in December with the highest application count (4,314) and record funding ($53.9M) and repayments ($58.1M).
- Most loans (86%) fall under the “Fully Paid” category, demonstrating strong repayment and risk management performance.

**Loan Status**

- Fully Paid loans dominate the portfolio (32,145), supporting $411.6M received on $351.4M funded. These loans maintain the lowest average interest rate (11.6%) and debt-to-income ratio (13.2%), indicators of lower credit risk.
- Charged Off loans (5,333) account for $65.5M funded but only $37.3M received, reflecting lost principal from defaults. Their higher interest rates (13.9%) and DTI (14.0%) call for continued attention to underwriting criteria.
- Current loans (1,098) show higher interest (15.1%) and DTI (14.7%), warranting future monitoring for potential risk escalation.

**Geographic Distribution**

- Loans are well distributed, with California, New York, Texas, and Florida originating the largest volumes and dollar amounts. These states represent the primary engines of portfolio growth and opportunity for further penetration.

**Loan Term Structure**

- The majority of loans are issued on 36-month terms (28,237 loans, $273M funded), while 60-month loans, though fewer, account for significant funding ($162.7M). Term duration reflects both borrower preference and lending strategy for balancing repayment schedules and liquidity.

**Borrower and Purpose Insights**

- Debt consolidation is the top use of funds (18,214 applications, $232.5M funded), followed by credit card refinancing and home improvement. This highlights consumer priorities and opportunities for tailored product offerings.
- Home ownership status: "MORTGAGE" and "RENT" collectively account for almost all loans funded, with $219.3M and $185.8M, respectively, pointing to strong market alignment in the book.
- Employee tenure: Individuals with 10+ years of employment secured the largest funded amounts, confirming the predictive value of employment stability for healthy lending outcomes.

## Conclusions

The bank’s portfolio is robust, with sustained growth, strong repayment, and stable credit quality. Most risk resides in the charged-off segment, which records higher losses and risk metrics. The data suggest optimal performance by focusing attention on customers with longer employment, mortgage or rental ownership, and debt consolidation needs. Geographic distribution further identifies high-opportunity regions, while the term profile and monthly trends aid liquidity and forecasting.

## Recommendations

1. **Refine Risk Underwriting**: Sharpen criteria for higher-risk cohorts identified by elevated DTI and interest rates, especially among charged-off and current loans.
2. **Expand Focus in Leading States**: Strengthen market share in states with the highest growth, while evaluating underserved geographies for incremental gains.
3. **Align Products with Purpose Trends**: Enhance offerings in debt consolidation, credit card, and home improvement segments to meet borrower demand.
4. **Continue Prioritizing Employment Stability**: Maintain strict employment tenure standards to ensure ongoing portfolio health.
5. **Leverage Seasonal and Term Insights**: Prepare for high-volume months, especially Q4, and adapt product terms to borrower repayment preferences for optimal results.
